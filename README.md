# Husky RFCs

[HuskyRFCs]: #husky-rfcs

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent
and controlled path for changes to Husky (such as new features) so that all 
stakeholders can be confident about the direction of the project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Husky community and
the [sub-team]s.
